A term of type $A$ in context $\Gamma$, is just a morphism from $A$ to $\Gamma$.
Again we need to distinguish two cases, because morphisms between sets are something different than morphisms between presheaves.
For sets, we just use functions.
For presheaves, we use natural transformations instead.

\begin{code}
Tm : {b : ClockContext} (Γ : Ctx b) (A : Ty b) → Set
Tm {∅} Γ A = Γ → A
Tm {κ} Γ A = NatTrans Γ A
\end{code}
