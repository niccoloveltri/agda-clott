\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Coinduction allows programming and reasoning with possibly nonterminating programs and potentially infinite objects.
In this paper, we compare two approaches for extending type theory with coinduction and coinductive types.
More specifically, we show that guarded recursion and guarded recursive types can be simulated with sized types.
We do this by defining a model of guarded recursion in type theory extended with sized types.
The model is variation of the topos of trees, and it is formalized in Agda.

\section{Categorical Semantics}

Next we give a categorical semantics for the calculus introduced in
\Cref{sec:syntax}.  We take inspiration from M{\o}gelberg's model
\cite{Mogelberg14} in which a (simple) type in a clock context
containing $n$ clocks is interpreted
as a presheaf in $\Set^{(\omega^n)^{\text{op}}}$, where $\omega$ is
the preorder of ordered natural numbers. In our model we replace the
category $\omega$ with the preorder of sizes. Moreover we only
consider the cases where either the clock context is empty or it
contains exactly one clock. This means that a type in \GTT\ is either
interpreted as an element of \F{Set} or as a presheaf over \F{Size}. 
In this section we show how to implement presheaves and how to model
the fragment of \GTT\ corresponding to simply typed lambda
calculus. The interpretation of the guarded recursive and coinductive
features of \GTT\ is given in Section \ref{sec:guarded}.

the context operations, the simple type formers and the operations on substitutions.
Since their definitions are standard, we do not discuss them in detail.
For each of them, we need to make a case distinction based on the clock context.
For example, the empty variable context \IC{‚Ä¢} is interpreted either as the unit type
or as the terminal presheaf, depending on the clock context.
We use the operations on presheaves defined in \Cref{sec:presheaves} to interpret simple type formers.

\section{Modelling Guarded Recursion}
\label{sec:guarded}
In this section, we add the required guarded
recursive and coinductive features to the denotational semantics.
%Now we have the simple type formers and their terms.
%The next step is to add the type formers required for guarded recursion.
We start by defining the semantic box modality together with its
introduction and elimination rule. Then we construct the semantic
later modality. We show how to define the fixpoint combinator and the
force operation using sized types. In the end, we discuss how to model
guarded recursive types.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:concl}
We presented a simple type theory for guarded recursion that we called \GTT. We
formalized its syntax and semantics in Agda. Crucially, sized types
were employed for giving an interpretation to the characteristic
features of guarded recursion. From this we conclude that guarded
recursion can be simulated using sized types. We greatly benefited
of the fact that sized types constitute a native feature of Agda, so
we were able to fully develop our theory inside a proof assistent. 

This work can be extended is several different directions.
Various type theories for guarded recursion in the literature include
dependent types. Currently, there exist two disciplines for mixing
dependent types with guarded recursion: delayed substitutions
\cite{bizjak2016guarded} and ticks \cite{BahrGM17}. It would be interesting to extend
the syntax and semantics of \GTT\ with dependent types following one
of these methods.

Abel and Vezzosi \cite{AbelV14} formalized a simple type theory
extended with the later modality in Agda. They focus on operational
properties of the calculus and give a certified proof of strong
normalization. As future work, we plan to investigate the metatheory
and the dynamic behaviour of \GTT\ by formalizing a  type
checker and a normalization algorithm.



\remove{
and weakening, and we constructed denotational semantics for it in type theory extended with sized types.
From this, we concluded that this theory is consistent and that guarded recursion can be defined via sized types.

There are several possible ways to improve on this result.
First of all, one could define a dependent version of this type theory extended with multiple clocks.
This can be done in two ways.
Either one extends the object theory with delayed substitutions \cite{bizjak2016guarded} or with ticks \cite{BahrGM17}.
Second of all, with the deep embedding in place, one can further study the meta-theory by defining a formalized type checking and a normalization algorithm.
}

Finally, we want to understand weather it is possible to reduce sized
types to guarded recursion.  This does not seems directly doable,
since sizes are not uniquely employed with coinductive types as a tool
for easing the productivity check of corecursive definitions, but they
are also used as auxiliary arguments of inductive types for
facilitating the termination check of recursive definitions. It seems
that, in order to capture this dual aspect of sizes, one needs to
extend the existing type theories for guarded recursion with
additional features.
